An Xcode project can generate a lot of files that are specific to the development environment, and are not necessary to include in version control. A .gitignore file is a simple text file that specifies files and directories that Git should ignore when tracking changes to the repository. You can create a .gitignore file in the root of your Xcode project, and add the following lines to ignore common Xcode-generated files and directories:

# Xcode
#
# gitignore contributors: remember to update Global/Xcode.gitignore, Objective-C.gitignore & Swift.gitignore

## Build generated
build/
DerivedData/

## Various settings
*.pbxuser
!default.pbxuser
*.mode1v3
!default.mode1v3
*.mode2v3
!default.mode2v3
*.perspectivev3
!default.perspectivev3
xcuserdata/

## Other
*.moved-aside
*.xccheckout
*.xcuserstate

## Obj-C/Swift specific
*.hmap
*.ipa
*.dSYM.zip
*.dSYM

# CocoaPods
#
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control
#
# Pods/

# Carthage
#
# Add this line if you want to avoid checking in source code from Carthage dependencies.
# Carthage/Checkouts

# fastlane
#
# It is recommended to not store the screenshots in the git repo. Instead, use fastlane to re-generate the
# screenshots whenever they are needed.
# For more information about the recommended setup visit:
# https://docs.fastlane.tools/best-practices/source-control/#source-control

fastlane/report.xml
fastlane/Preview.html
fastlane/screenshots

# Code Signing
#
# If you wish to share your code signing files, it is recommended to add them to gitignore
#
# *.cert
# *.mobileprovision
This will ignore the build-related files, user-specific settings and files, debug files and also the fastlane and code signing files. It’s important to note that, depending on the structure and setup of your project, this list may not cover all files that you may want to ignore. You may need to tweak the .gitignore file to include other files or directories specific to your project.
